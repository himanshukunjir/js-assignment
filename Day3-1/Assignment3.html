<h1>JavaScript Day 3 Assignment 3</h1>

<p>Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.: </p>
<h4>Strings</h4>
<p> Strings are used for storing text. Strings must be inside of either double or single quotes. In JS, Strings are immutable (they cannot be changed).
A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters. I start a string by typing double quotes, single quotes, or the backtick character. Double quote and single quote behave identically, and the backtick character comes with some extra functionality.</p>
<h4>Numbers </h4>
<p>  Numbers are as straightforward as they sound. Numbers are for numbers. I can’t put a letter on here. It’s no longer a number, and the coloring gets funky. It’s no longer green. But I can make this number be as long as I want it. I cannot add a comma, but I can add a decimal point. So numbers are any integer or decimal number created in the language, and they’re used for money, age, etc. the same kinds of things that we use money for here in real life.
</p>
<h4>Booleans</h4>
<p> Booleans have two values. True and false. When we create a boolean, we’re simply saying it’s true or it’s false. It’s like that on/off switch example that we talked about. It’s all there is to them right now. We’re gonna talk into other aspects of playing into these variables in another time.
These were strings. This is number, and this is a boolean, also called a bool, from time to time. All right. Next up, we’re gonna talk about null and undefined.
</p>
<h4> Null And Undefined</h4>
<p> In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.You can empty an object by setting it to null.</p>
<p>

You can also empty an object by setting it to undefined:</p>

</h4>Difference Between Undefined and Null</h4>
<p>
undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:
